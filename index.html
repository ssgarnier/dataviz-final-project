      <h1>For Craft Brewers, It's "Go Small and Go Home"</h1>
      <p>How a maturing industry forces beer makers to re-think their business model.</p>
      <p>By Stephanie Garnier

</p>

      
      <p>After years of exponential growth, the market for
regional craft breweries started shrinking in 2015 due to saturation,
high production cost and increasing competition from macro-brews.
According to the Brewers Association, regional craft beer breweries
produce between 15,000 and six million barrels of beer per year while
micro-breweries, brewpubs and contractors produce less than 15,000
barrels.

      <p>According to
the Huffington Post, craft breweries generally face higher value chain
costs compared to macro-breweries. This results from a lack of
economies of scale, a preference for higher quality ingredients,
advanced production techniques such as barrel aging, and a lack of
well-established sales and distribution channels. By selling beers
locally, for example, adopting the brewpub model, beer makers can cut
distribution and retail cost or keep them to a minimum.
</p>

<p>In addition to value chain cost, craft beer brewers should also
consider the ideal location for their brewery based on state population
size and existing number of craft breweries per capita. Brewers
following the brewpub or microbrewery models, both of which do not
allow for a wide distribution circle, should focus on states that have
a lower brewery-per-capita ratio and higher number of people aged 21+.
Favorable states are California, Colorado, Texas, Florida and New York.</p><br>
